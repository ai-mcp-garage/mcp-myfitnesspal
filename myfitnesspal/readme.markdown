Do you track your eating habits on [MyFitnessPal](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/)? Have you ever wanted to
analyze the information you\'re entering into MyFitnessPal
programatically?

Although MyFitnessPal [does have an API](https://www.myfitnesspal.com/api), it is private-access
only; this creates an unnecessary barrier between you and your data that
can be overcome using this library.
